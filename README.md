## Heaps Data Structure
# A heap is a specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property. 

# Max Heap: The value of each node is greater than or equal to the values of its children. The maximum value is at the root.
# Min Heap: The value of each node is less than or equal to the values of its children. The minimum value is at the root.
# Heaps are commonly used to implement priority queues and sorting algorithms like heapsort.

## Features
# Insertion: Adding a new element while maintaining the heap property.
# Deletion: Removing the root element (max or min) and restoring the heap property.

## Usage
# Priority Queues: Scheduling tasks based on priority.
# Sorting: Implementing the heapsort algorithm.

## Implementation
# This repository contains an implementation of a heap data structure in [language]. The code includes:
# Heap class: Defines the basic structure and operations of a heap.
# Insert method: Adds a new element to the heap while maintaining the heap property.
# Remove method: Removes the root element and restores the heap property.
# Heapify method: Converts an arbitrary array into a heap.
